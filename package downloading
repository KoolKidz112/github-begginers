here is how to create a package so you can download things.
(i got this from gibfahn or someone like him)
node.js

mkdir <pkg name>
cd <pkg name>
npm init

the package should be created
type the name and all other info,
and there you go
if your pretty confused with the <pkg name> tag, that just means put whatever you want for your package name
